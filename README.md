# Stream Tools

IrcLite is a small library that uses WebSocket api to connect IRC.
Limited functionality.

OBSWebSocket is a small library to handle OBS scene switching and various other settings. Nothing overkill 

VoiceCaptioning is a wrapper around the SpeechRecognition API in Chrome.

All together it's a series of tools for streamers in a small Vite tooling app.
